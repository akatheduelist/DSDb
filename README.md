# DSDb
The Doug Score Database uses the famous automotive journalist Doug DeMuro's iconic spreadsheet of 600+ vehicle reviews and turns it into a web app that can be used by automotive enthusiasts to search and sort vehicles by scores and other metrics. Users of DSDb can also add their own information and scoring to each vehicle to create their own community score..
